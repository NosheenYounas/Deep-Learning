Deep Learning Project

Overview

This project applies deep learning techniques to solve [insert problem, e.g., image classification, natural language processing, etc.]. It utilizes neural networks and frameworks such as TensorFlow/PyTorch to build, train, and evaluate models.

Features

Data preprocessing and augmentation

Neural network architecture design

Model training and validation

Performance evaluation using key metrics

Model inference for real-world data

Prerequisites

Python 3.8 or higher

TensorFlow 2.x or PyTorch (specify version)

NumPy

Pandas

Matplotlib

Scikit-learn

Install dependencies using:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Installation

Clone the repository:

git clone https://github.com/your-repo/deep-learning-project.git

Navigate to the project directory:

cd deep-learning-project

Install the dependencies:

pip install -r requirements.txt

Dataset

The dataset used is [insert dataset name, e.g., CIFAR-10, MNIST]. Download and place it in the data directory. Ensure the dataset structure matches the expected format.

Usage

Data Preparation:

python data_preprocessing.py

Train the Model:

python train.py

Evaluate the Model:

python evaluate.py

Inference:

python inference.py --image_path path/to/image.jpg

Configuration

Modify hyperparameters and settings in config.yaml, including:

Learning rate

Batch size

Number of epochs

Network architecture

Results

After training, results such as accuracy and loss curves will be saved in the results directory. Model checkpoints are saved in checkpoints.
